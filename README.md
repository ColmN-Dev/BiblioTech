# BiblioTech

BiblioTech is a Flask-based book discovery application. The project has been refactored into a Flask application factory + package structure and uses PostgreSQL through Flask-SQLAlchemy.

The application uses the Google Books API to allow users to search for books, view book details, and explore available book information.

## Current Status

The codebase currently includes:

- Flask application factory setup with blueprint registration
- Environment-based configuration
- SQLAlchemy initialization
- PostgreSQL database connection
- Flask-Migrate configuration
- Initial database schema and migrations
- Google Books API integration
- Centralised API request handling with timeout, retry support, and fallback handling
- Retry logic for temporary Google Books API failures across search and carousel requests
- Search functionality with pagination
- Book detail pages
- Dynamic homepage quote section
- Google Books powered homepage carousel
- Genre-based random book selection for homepage content
- Homepage genre grid with 24 curated genres linking to search results
- Carousel navigation controls, active indicators, and auto-rotation
- Corrected marketplace buy links on the book detail page
- Responsive frontend layouts
- Styled authentication pages
- User signup with password validation
- Password hashing with Flask-Bcrypt
- User login/logout with Flask-Login
- Login-protected library route with `@login_required`
- Navigation updates based on authentication state
- Password visibility toggle
- Search input clearing functionality
- Mobile navigation menu with overlay and background scroll lock

Additional features, including full personal library workflows and reviews, are still being implemented.

The database models have been designed and the initial migration has been successfully applied using Flask-Migrate.

## Setup

1. Open a terminal in the `BiblioTech` folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - PowerShell: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   - Command Prompt: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional but recommended) set environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`

5. Apply the database migrations:

```bash
python -m flask db upgrade
```

For hosted PostgreSQL (for example Render), ensure your `DATABASE_URL` includes `sslmode=require`.

---

## Run

Local development:

```bash
python run.py
```

Gunicorn deployment:

```bash
gunicorn run:app
```

For database management commands:

```bash
python -m flask db <command>
```

## Routing Structure

- `app/routes.py` → main pages (`/`, `/search-results`, `/book/<book_id>`, `/library`, `/about`)
- `app/auth/routes.py` → auth routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/logout`)
- `app/auth/__init__.py` → auth blueprint setup

Template links and redirects for authentication use blueprint-qualified endpoints:

- `url_for('auth.login')`
- `url_for('auth.signup')`
- `url_for('auth.logout')`

## Refactor Notes

- Route links were updated from old endpoint references to `auth.*` where required.
- Blueprint import/registration order was adjusted to avoid circular import issues between `app/__init__.py` and `app/auth/routes.py`.
- Required `db.relationship(...)` references were added/debugged during auth integration.

## Implemented Routes

- `/` → Home (`index.html`)
- `/search-results` → Query-driven book search using Google Books API, with pagination (`search_results.html`)
- `/book/<book_id>` → Book detail view using API book information (`book_detail.html`)
- `/library` → Your library (`your_library.html`)
- `/about` → About (`about.html`)
- `/auth/login` → Login (`auth/login.html`)
- `/auth/signup` → Sign up (`auth/signup.html`)
- `/auth/logout` → Clear session and redirect to login
