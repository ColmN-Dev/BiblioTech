# BiblioTech

BiblioTech is a Flask-based book discovery application. The project has been refactored into a Flask application factory + package structure and uses PostgreSQL through Flask-SQLAlchemy.

The application uses the Google Books API to allow users to search for books, view book details, save books to a personal library, and leave reviews.

## Setup

1. Open a terminal in the `BiblioTech` folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - PowerShell: `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   - Command Prompt: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional but recommended) set environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`

5. Apply the database migrations:

```bash
python -m flask db upgrade
```

For hosted PostgreSQL (for example Render), ensure your `DATABASE_URL` includes `sslmode=require`.

---

## Run

Local development:

```bash
python run.py
```

Gunicorn deployment:

```bash
gunicorn run:app
```

For database management commands:

```bash
python -m flask db <command>
```
---

## Routing Structure

- `app/routes.py` → main pages (`/`, `/search-results`, `/book/<book_id>`, `/library`, `/about`)
- `app/auth/routes.py` → auth routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/logout`)
- `app/auth/__init__.py` → auth blueprint setup

Template links and redirects for authentication use blueprint-qualified endpoints:

- `url_for('auth.login')`
- `url_for('auth.signup')`
- `url_for('auth.logout')`

---

## Implemented Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Homepage |
| `/search-results` | Search books |
| `/book/<book_id>` | Book details |
| `/book/<book_id>/review` | Create or update review |
| `/book/<book_id>/review/delete` | Delete review |
| `/library` | Personal library |
| `/about` | About page |
| `/auth/login` | Login |
| `/auth/signup` | Register |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |
